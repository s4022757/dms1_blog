# Session 1

## Introducing Colour Theory

To start off the session, THomas gave a presentation on Colour Theory.

We were taught the definitions of:
- Hue: The difference between colours.
- Saturation: The purity and intensity of a colour's hue.
- Value: The relative lightness or darkness of a colour.

We were then taught about different types of colour palettes:
- Monochromatic
- Analogous
- Complimentary
- Split Complimentary
- Triadic

We then discussed how colours can either **contrast** or **harmonise** with each other, and also how they are associated with concepts.

## Defining Flat Design

The next presentation was around Flat Design, which we will be utilising in Assignment 2.

Things to remember about Flat Design:
- **Simplicity** is key!
- Simplify objects and remove details
- Minimal number of elements
- Exclude complex colours, gradients, highlights, texture & shadows
- Avoid 3D effects
- Uses geometric rather than organic shapes

The presentation mentioned that Flat Design is used in App logo design. Perhaps this could instead be the context for my icon suite.

## Introducing Illustrator's Pen tool

The presentation then moved onto the Pen tool.

It can be used to:
- Draw straight lines
- Draw curves
- Adjust curves
- Add & remove points
- Convert corners to curves & vice-versa.

## Pen tool activities

Now aware of the pen tool and its uses, we started some activities to practice with its use.

### The Bézier Game

We were directed to [The Bézier Game](https://bezier.method.ac) to practice on first.

This is a web based game that uses the same controls as Illustrator's pen tool in order for you to create a closed path around a pre-defined shape.

Here is some of the progress I made:

![Plane Path](/w05s01/Bezier_Game/Bezier_Plane.png)

*I hate this game!*

### Practicing in Illustrator

Then, we moved into Illustrator to practice drawing paths on a few templates.

Here is the first template:

And my progress:

![First Template Complete](/w05s01/Pen_Tool_Practice/Pen1progress2.png)

Completed!

Now, the second template:

Progress:

Completed!

### Using Pen & Shape tools

Then next activity required use to combine the use of the pen and shape tools in order to recreate the following image:

So, lets now use our new skills to recreate it!

![Progress 1](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress1.png)

![Progress 2](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress2.png)

![Progress 3](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress3.png)

![Progress 4](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress4.png)

![Progress 5](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress5.png)

![Progress 6](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress6.png)

![Progress 7](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress7.png)

![Progress 8](/w05s01/Black_Rabbit/progress8.png)

That should do it! Here is the completed activity:

### Tracing Activity

## LinkedIn Learning Illustrator

For homework, I returned to the *Illustrator 2024 Essential Training* course by Tony Harmer and continued on.

Chapter 4: Path Drawing

![Chapter 4](/w05s01/LiL_Illustrator/Chapter4.png)

Good advice![^1] 
[^1]*Although I'm unsure I'll ever master the pen tool.*

Chapter 6: Colour

Chapter 8: Strokes

![Chapter 8](/w05s01/LiL_Illustrator/Chapter8.png)


Aced them quizes!

With these new skills, I should be able to start converting my sketches into flat design icons.

# Session 2

## LinkedIn Learning Illustrator

For homework, I returned to the *Illustrator 2024 Essential Training* course by Tony Harmer and again continued on.

Chapter 10: Organising Content

![Chapter 10](/w05s02/LiL_Illustrator/Chapter10.png)


Chapter 11: Groups

![Chapter 11](/w05s02/LiL_Illustrator/Chapter11.png)


Getting pretty good at these quizes!

Should now have the skills I need to complete the designs for my icon suite.

## LinkedIn Learning HTML

Since we will be hosting our icon suites on a html document, I better learn some more about HTML. I navigated to LinkedIn Learning's *HTML Essential Training* course by Jen Simmons

Chapter 1: HTML

![Chapter 1](/w05s02/LiL_HTML/Chapter1.png)


Chapter 2: Formatting text

![Chapter 2](/w05s02/LiL_HTML/Chapter2.png)


Chapter 5: Images & Graphics

![Chapter 5](/w05s02/LiL_HTML/Chapter5.png)


That should be enough for me to navigate and personalise the HTML template we were provided. JavaScript will be a challenge for later.
