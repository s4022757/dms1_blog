# Session 1

## Learning Illustrator

This week, after submitting Digital Design Project 1, we've moved away from video editing on Premiere and onto graphic design on Illustrator. 


## Design Thinking

At the start of this session, Thomas gave a presentation around the concept of "Design thinking". 

This is a 5 stage cyclical process which can be implemented to help guide and focus our approach to design. It emphasising a reflective and empathetic approach to the design process and encourages repeated iterative prototypes. If implemented, this framework should help refine the final product and enhance its impact on the audience.

The 5 stages of the process are:

## Black Squares activity - Part 1

The first task we were assigned was a thumbnail sketching activity. In this activity we were provided with six words and were asked to compose eight thumbnail sketches using Illustrator in response to each. However, there was a catch. The only means we had to completed the sketches was exactly 4 solid black squares; no more, no less. 

Once all 48 thumbnail sketches were completed, a final sketch would be selected for each prompt word.

While in class, I opened up Illustrator for what was the first time and rushed quickly to complete a single thumbnail sketch for each word.

The activity demanded fast paced responses to the prompts and the limitations imposed dissuaded us from spending too much time on each sketch.

While a single response to each prompt was good, it was clear that I would need to pick up the pace in order to complete all 48 sketches in a timely manner.


## LinkedIn Learning Illustrator

In order to familiarise myself with Illustrator, and improve my time efficiency using the program, I jumped on to LinkedIn Learning and opened up the *Illustrator 2024 Essential Training* course by Tony Harmer.

I made my way through the videos and quizes through to chapter 3.

Chapter 1: Environment

Aced the quizes!

With this completed, I'll now return to the black squares.

## Black Squares - Part 2

Now equip with fledgling Illustrator capabilities, I cracked on with the black squares activity. Following a design thinking work flow, I had reached a first prototype. I will now return to the ideation phase and begun creating a few more iterations per word.

One of the tools I learnt more about via Tony was correct use of the shape tools. No more copy and pasting the orginal squares provided in the template!

I've now reached another prototype, this time complete. Now to move on to testing... *I wonder what my flatmates think?*

## Assignment 2

The second assignment is coming up, and I will need to continue utilising Illustrator to create an icon suite.

### Prompts

The assignment has given these prompts to work with:

- Growth
- Home
- Movement
- Climate
- Community
- Future
- Empty
- Legacy
- Calm
- Memory
- System
- Dream

Out of these, the prompts that appeal most to me must be:

- Community
- Memory
- System
- Dream

Following the design thinking workflow, I should refine my selection by first empathising with my audience... *You, dear reader.*

**What is likely to matter most to my audience?**

My initial thoughts are that the best subject matter should be clearly communicated through the medium of flat design icons.

I fear that *dream* is quite abstract and very subjective. This prompt should be first to go.

Another limitation with the medium will be the amount of complexity afforded in an icon. This means that if choosing *system*, the audience may find the work overcomplicated and less effective at communicating a clean, simple and pleaseing final product. Let's get rid of that too.

That leaves two. Both *community* and *memory* are concepts that I think could be communicated effectively to my audience. Lets move on to the next stage of the design thinking worflow, defining.

**Memory** is the storage of information, but this can mean multiple things. There can be both personal memories of our past, along with the storage of data on a technological medium.

**Community** is when a group is connected through shared space, characteristics, values, or interests.

Now with definitions, I immediately notice that *memory*, with it's multiple interpretations may be hard to communicate with a unified suite of icons. This means that I'd likely have to stick to a single interpretation and as personal memories are incredibly subjective, I would lean towards the technological definition.

To move back to the empathise stage of design thinking, it is clear that the ommission of the personal definition of *memory* in order to acheive unity throughout the suite might also detract from how the final product is recieved.

That leaves **Community**, my choice for now.

### Mindmapping

Thomas mentioned in class a note taking program called Obsidian. I recently downloaded it and have found it great. One of the functionalities of the program is the Canvas. I've used this to create a mindmap around the term *community*.

In the image above, the grey boxes contain concepts, red boxes a possible icon, and purple are possible variations.

### Platform, Context, & Audience

As part of the assignment brief, we are required to describe the platform, context and intended audience for our icon suites.

#### Platform

If I am to represent community through icons, then what platform would suit this best?

The immediately obvious platform would be social media, as many of today's current communities are virtual. 

How are these platforms accessed?

While smart phones allow for constant access to these platforms on the go, the small aspect of their displays mean that relevant icons would have to be down-scalable so my icons would have limited complexity.

My preference then would be a desktop view of a sopcial media platform via web browser.

#### Context

If these icons are to be designed for a desktop social media website, then in which context would the icons be used on the platform?

Every website needs navigational elements, so this seems to be the best fit for the icon's context.

That said, community would be associated with most sections of a social media platform and it may be hard to differentiate what section each icon represents. The icons might be better suited to be used as section headers instead of navigational elements. May need to revisit this if problems arise.

#### Audience

What kind of audience utilises social media platforms?

Let's set out a few metrics for us to define:

- Age
- Interests
- Background

##### Age 

While digital literacy now spans across all living generations, it would be best to refine a specific age range. 

The youngest generations are likely to participate in education which could provide them physical community to engage with rather than via social media. There is also the fact that many social media platforms require a minimum age for membership. With that, let's nix the youngest.

Older generations may already participate in physical communities, so would have less need for virtual community. Also, they would likely comprise a smaller demographic of social media platform membership. Let us also nix the eldest.

With that done, let us say that the age range of our intended audience is adults, say **20-40 year olds**.

##### Interests

What interests would our audience share?

Since the audience is using a social media platform, lets assume that our audience all values:

- Communication
- Connection
- Cooperation
- Collaboration
- Diversity
- Inclusion
- Social Wellbeing

With this defined, let's remember these concepts as possible concepts to visualise in our icons.

##### Background

With this age range and these shared interests, lets set out a likely background for our audience.

Our audience has now left the support and community found in their family home and the education system. They are navigating careers and professional communities, although this form of community is not enough alone. They are utilising the platform in order to build new community or strengthen existing community through connecting and communicating with others that share this interest. Virtual communities can thrive beyond geographic bounds, and enable the collaboration and inclusion of people from a diversity of areas. Our audience seeks to utilise this platform to build community, to support and improve the wellbeing of all involved.


# Session 2

## Icon Design

Thomas started the session with a presentation on Icon Design.


An important takeaway was that icons tend not to be used alone. Therefore icons must work together, especially in an icon suite.

This means that they should be unified through:
- Consistent use of style & colour.
- Consistent use of elements such as line and shape.
- Consistent use of angles.
- Alignment of elements across icons

Another takeaway is that the first step in developing an icon suite is *thumbnail sketching*, which are small, quick, and rough sketches. Sounds like a good way to draft iterations.
