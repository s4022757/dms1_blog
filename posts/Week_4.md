# Session 1

### Learning Illustrator

This week, after submitting Digital Design Project 1, we've moved away from video editing on Premiere and onto graphic design on Illustrator. 


### Design Thinking

At the start of this session, Thomas gave a presentation around the concept of "Design thinking". 

This is a 5 stage cyclical process which can be implemented to help guide and focus our approach to design. It emphasising a reflective and empathetic approach to the design process and encourages repeated iterative prototypes. If implemented, this framework should help refine the final product and enhance its impact on the audience.

The 5 stages of the process are:

### Black Squares activity - Part 1

The first task we were assigned was a thumbnail sketching activity. In this activity we were provided with six words and were asked to compose eight thumbnail sketches using Illustrator in response to each. However, there was a catch. The only means we had to completed the sketches was exactly 4 solid black squares; no more, no less. 

Once all 48 thumbnail sketches were completed, a final sketch would be selected for each prompt word.

While in class, I opened up Illustrator for what was the first time and rushed quickly to complete a single thumbnail sketch for each word.

The activity demanded fast paced responses to the prompts and the limitations imposed dissuaded us from spending too much time on each sketch.

While a single response to each prompt was good, it was clear that I would need to pick up the pace in order to complete all 48 sketches in a timely manner.


### LinkedIn Learning Illustrator

In order to familiarise myself with Illustrator, and allow me improve my time efficientcy using the program, I jumped on to LinkedIn Learning and opened up the *Illustrator 2024 Essential Training* course by Tony Harmer.

I made my way through the videos and quizes through to chapter 3.

Aced the quizes!

With this completed, I'll now return to the black squares.
