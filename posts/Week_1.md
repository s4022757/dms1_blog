# Week 1

## Session 1

### Scavenger Hunt

During the first session Thomas asked us to get into groups and take a selfie with as many of the objects we could find around campus.

I grouped up with Hayden and Amanda.

Here are the objects that we were able to find:

_An explosive cup of coffee._

_A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many._

_A golden globe atop a tower of eights._

We found 6/10 of the objects in the scavenger hunt. I'd call that a pass!

I've set up a vimeo account, in order to upload my soon to be completed self-portrait.
