# Week 1

## Session 1

### Scavenger Hunt

During the first session Thomas asked us to get into groups and take a selfie with as many of the objects we could find around campus.

I grouped up with Hayden and Amanda.

Here are the objects that we were able to find:

_An explosive cup of coffee._

_A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many._

_A golden globe atop a tower of eights._

We found 6/10 of the objects in the scavenger hunt. I'd call that a pass!


## Session 2

### Self-Portrait

### Learning Premiere

Utilising the access RMIT students receive to Linkedin Learning, I've been going through the *Premiere Pro Essential Training* Course by Ashley Kennedy.

So far, I've completed up to chapter 5.
