# Session 1

## Form

To start the session off, Thomas gave a lecture on **form** in relation to the 3D assets available in Unity.

When the lecture came to examining **Cubic form**, the points resonated with me and I made sure to take notes. Thomas mentioned that rectangular form adds *directionality* and encourages movement along surfaces.

This will be important considering the environment I've been developing. Thinking back to drafted cityscape scene, the rectangular form of the skyscrapers should assist in guiding the player further down the avenue leading to the scene transition. While theory around form supports this, it may not be entirely enough wayfinding to ensure the player reaches the destintation. Let's keep this in mind.

Another point made was about **Angular form.** Thomas mentioned that sharp or spiky forms can feel dangerous and unwelcoming.

This brought me back to thinking about the seaside scene I've drafted. As this scene is meant to be calming, I'll have to remember to avoid any sharp edges. The headlands might need some smoothing out.

## Importing Assets

Thomas then mentioned SketchFab, a 3D asset sharing platform and marketplace. Luckily SketchFab also provides a plugin for unity to directly import assets into a project.

Let's install the plug in and try bringing in an asset.

There's quite a lot to choose from!

Let's find something relevant.

## Designing Space

Next, Thomas gave another lecture which expanded on designing in three dimensions.

### Space & Void

To start things off, we discussed space versus empty space.

While empty space in reality is often unconsidered, in enironmental design it is something that must be *constructed*.

**Void**, along with **form**, help guide a user through an environment and influence its affect.

Thomas reinforced the point that forms and the void which surrounds them are equally as important. That is to say that when composing a 3D environment, it is important to consider not only the shape of an object, but also the shape of the empty space that is created beween objects.

This will be important to remember with my environment, especially with the transition between cityscape and seaside.

## Homework

### LinkedIn Learning

To build further on the skills we've been developing in unity, I returned to the *Unity 2023 Essential training* course on LinkedIn Learning.

Now I know how to add physics rules to objects. Useful stuff. 

While Chapter 9 is about audio and we've not quite got there yet, I couldn't resist.

### Improving the greyboxes

So with the new knowledge about designing space along with importing assets, lets return to the greyboxes.

#### Cityscape

With the sketchfab plugin, lets have a look for some assets and replace the greyboxes with prefab buildings.

The environment is looking much better with real buildings rather than grey boxes. While it would be great to build some 3D models myself, I'm sure I'd quickly lose track of time.

Lets have a look for some more.

The detail in some of the freely availble models are meticulous!

With a little more knowledge about void rectangular form, let's also now rearange the buildings with this in mind.

While it's going to need some more work, the rectangular form of the new skyscrapers and the spaces inbetween do help draw attention further down the avenue and towards the portal.

For reference, here is a bird's eye view of the improved scene.
