# Assignment Evaluations

## A1 - Self Portrait

### How did you approach the **relationship** between the sonic and visual components of your edit? 

Many of the sonic elements included in the edit were sourced from the video clips themselves. While external sound effects and music were implemented, it was mainly to support immersion and the emotional tone of the film. The initial montage was intended to increase in tempo with ambient mechanical sound effects also building to convey chaos and monotony, then at the crescendo to fade into static ringing accompanying the fade to white. Then audio visual elements were to transition along with an emotional shift in the film. This was lead with the cliche stock music record player gag which was included to introduce comedic relief and convey a sense of optimism in the finale. Due to time limitations the the initial concept was not fully realised in the final edit. Instead, the montage was left without musical backing in order to convey mundanity rather than anxiety. Techniques such as match cuts and J-Cuts were implemented to enhance the continuity of the film's flow and demonstrate some intermediate editing techniques. 


### How did you decide on the **footage** that you used to shape your project? 

As this film was a self-portrait, I wanted to capture both a day in my life but also convey how these habits have motivated a pursuit of tertiary education. 

The majority of the initial montage comprised of footage captured both at home and the workplace with the remainder of clips capturing exploring the city by foot at night. The second section included the use of a record player which was to facilitate a comedic sequence, followed by a final sequence depicting my enrolment into RMIT. 

These clips were selected intentionally, to go beyond capturing a day in the life, and also represent subtext that the habits, interests and creative endeavours I depicted are things I aspire to develop or abandon throughout this course. 


### What did you learn about the power of sound to shape **emotional experience**, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project? 

Prior to the outset of creating this film, I was well aware of the emotional affect sound has on its audience. With that in mind, my initial concept included auditory components such as accumulating mechanical sounds to compliment the montage, the choir to accompany the epiphany, and the cliched stock music to accompany the emotional shift. 

During the editing process, I quickly realised that the overlaying of numerous sonic elements quickly muddied the clarity of the film and needed to be drawn back considerably. This realisation came also with new appreciation for foley sound effects as a crucial element of film making. While there was much room to improve the sound design of the final edit, I learnt that implementing foley FX aids the continuity of transitions and enhances the immersion and unity of the entire film.


### How does editing relate to the concepts of **pacing** and **rhythm**, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project? 

At the start of the process, an editor must select and assemble footage into a sequence, sculpting spacial or temporal connections between clips. This is done in order to affect the audience as intended, either by conveying a narrative or by simply eliciting a subtext from an otherwise miscellany of audio visual information.  

The editor's job is to select and assemble footage into a coherent sequence by means of sculpting spatial or temporal connections between clips. This is achieved by either conveying a narrative or by simply eliciting subtext out of an otherwise miscellany of audio visual information. 

Like the composer, the editor makes choices in pacing and rhythm within their respective mediums to guide and support the emotional flow of their work. Their ultimate goal is to affect their audiences as intended, as best they can.

Initially, the film was planned to open with a slice of life montage which was to hasten in pace with increasingly frenetic cuts between repeated scenes as the day cycle recurred. This would crescendo with rapid match cuts between the flowing movement of liquid from espresso machine, beer tap, and cocktail shaker and blurring any temporal continuity. While not fully realised, the concept was elicit an anxious and disorientated response to the monotonous inebriation and disorder within my personal life. Following a fade to white, the final sequence would then provide relief with a more coherent temporal flow, supporting the shift to an optimistic tone around enrolment into university.


### Which parts of your **personality, interests, past**, and **potential future** did you choose to depict in your portrait? 

The intention I had with my self-portrait was to both depict a day in my life, but also convey emotions felt during recent introspection, and ultimately my motivation to pursue higher education.

An important interest of mine is bartending, which I have pursed for the last 6 years as a full time career. This choice is well suited to my night owl tendencies and has provided me with a means to find community and purpose. That said, it has also enabled my abuse of substances, exacerbated disorder in my lifestyle and has contributed to me neglecting to develop other interests which I have depicted intentionally. 

Instead, I have only taken to consumptive rather than creative practices. I collect music more often than create. Instead of journaling psychogeographic explorations, I stumble blind through the night. Rather than capture my appreciation of the beauty of urban decay, day by day I have let myself slowly decay. 

Despite negative sentiments about my past, I am also open to change. I remain hopeful that further education may break the monotony, reintroduce sincerity, invigorate my curiosity and prompt development of my fledgling interests.
